# Project Overview

For this project, I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds that needs several test suits to be written using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). 


# Technologies

* HMTL
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT

# Launch

1. Clone the project from GitHub.
2. Open the index.html file to check the feeds and test suites

 The project does not have minimum hardware requirements.
 
Test example: ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
